    "summary": "Based on the confirmed object detection of 2 weapons and 2 persons, a potential security threat is present. Although the audio transcript suggests a non-hostile context, with the speaker mentioning firing a gun at a target, the presence of armed individuals warrants continued monitoring, but there is no indication of an active combat situation as no gunshots or explosions were detected in the audio."
