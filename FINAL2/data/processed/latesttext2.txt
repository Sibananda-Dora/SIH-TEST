Patrol Report 11 – ROMEO Team (Terrain Issue + Line-of-Sight Problems)
Team ID: PT-ROMEO
Base: Pahalgam CRPF Camp
Time: 21 April, 1:00 PM – 2:40 PM
Zone: Baisaran Upper Meadow → North Forest Slope
“Baisaran upper slope heavily obstructed by dense pine growth.
Even at 30–40 meters visibility drops drastically.
We noticed faint smoke residue near the ridge but no direct sightline due to slope geometry.
Team could not verify if it was a cooking fire or hostile movement.”
